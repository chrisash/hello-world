# hello-world
Just my first github repository

I decided to start learning programming. The last time I did anything involving "code" was html, but I think I'm years out of date on that. Prior to html, it was probably apple basic. Oh, my dad tried convincing me to learn pascal back in the 1980's, but that never really happened. So last night I began learning python with vim. Today I'm learning how to use github.
